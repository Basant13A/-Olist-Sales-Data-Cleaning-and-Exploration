# Olist Sales Data Cleaning and Exploration

## 📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning and preparing **Olist** sales data for future analysis and reporting. Using **Python** (with **Pandas** and **Matplotlib**), the data was cleaned, structured, and prepped for easy analysis. Key tasks included handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and performing **payment accuracy checks** and **reconciliation**.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for development and documentation)

## 🔍 Key Steps Performed

- **Handled missing values** to ensure completeness of the dataset
- **Corrected data inconsistencies** and removed duplicates for accuracy
- **Standardized date formats** and cleaned up categorical data
- **Performed payment accuracy checks**, ensuring all payment amounts matched expected totals
- **Conducted payment reconciliation** to confirm that all transactions were properly logged and matched with corresponding invoices
- Structured the data for easy analysis and visualization with **Pandas** and **Matplotlib**

## 📁 Files

- `olist_sales_cleaned.csv`: Final cleaned dataset, ready for analysis
- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the code used for cleaning, analysis, and payment checks
- `README.md`: Documentation of the process and project summary

## 📈 Outcome

The final dataset is clean, structured, and ready for analysis. It includes reconciled payment data and has been verified for payment accuracy. This dataset is ideal for generating reports, conducting deeper analysis, and making data-driven business decisions.
